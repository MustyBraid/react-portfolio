Hello! This is a portfolio/homepage by Casey Chartier, or Mustybraid if you prefer. My Github is located at https://github.com/MustyBraid and I can be reached by email at chartiercasey@gmail.com.

This is an exclusively front-end project that showcases a few neat things about React. At the moment it's really just a react router skeleton, but I think that's a really cool skeleton! It also uses webpack to make it into an installable app, which will help with hosting when I find a new place to do that.

This project was great for me because React is such an exciting framework. My group in the Bootcamp is cureently building something even more exciting with it, but this was a great way to mess around with the router. Excited to flesh this out!

A link to me giving a walkthrough of this project is currently hosted at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CutgQuMZnPN_QYS2GBTC0WZJopcIoDlQ/view
